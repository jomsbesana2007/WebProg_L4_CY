        <h2 id="plot">&lambda; Plot</h2>

        <p>The story begins at the Black Mesa facility in New Mexico in May of 200-, where the Resonsance Cascade occurred. The incident led to an explosion and the opening of a 'portal,' 
            causing alien creatures to go through the 'portal' and into Earth, ensuing destruction and chaos at the facility.</p>

        <p>After the incident had unfolded, the military quickly intervened at the facility to neutralise all witnesses—scientists 
            and security guards alike—to avoid word of the incident from reaching public knowledge.</p>

        <p>The player is responsible to bring Dr. Gordon Freeman, a recent MIT graduate, who is the silent main character of the first-person shooter game, 
            to safety and kill alien creatures and military personnel that come their way.</p>

        <h2 id="gameorigin">&lambda; Origins of Half-Life</h2>

        <p>Half-Life was the first product for the software-developer Valve Software. The company conceptualised an idea for a horror first-person shooter game. 
            Initially, Valve had struggled to find any publisher because many of them believed that their new product was too ambitious for a game developer as new as Valve. 
            However, they were able to break a deal with a publisher, Sierra On-Line, which was interested in publishing a first-person shooter game.</p>

        <p>One of Valve's founders, Gabe Newell, explained that they used the name 'Half-Life' because it was not clichéd, fits the theme of the game, 
            and the game had an evocative symbol, which is the Greek letter lambda (&lambda;), which represents the decay constant in the half-life equation. Hence, the name 'Half-Life' was used for the game.</p>

                <p>Carefully crafted for the single player experience, every encounter in Half-Life is a new challenge, nearly every room throws out something you haven't seen before, 
                    every sound is a worrying cue something horrible is about to happen. I haven't had so much fun playing a game in years.</p>
