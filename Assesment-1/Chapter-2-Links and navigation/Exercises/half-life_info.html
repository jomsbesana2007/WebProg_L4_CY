        <h2 id="#plot">Plot</h2>
        <p>The story begins at the Black Mesa facility in New Mexico in May of 200-, where the Resonsance Cascade occurred. The incident led to an explosion and the opening of a 'portal,' causing alien creatures to go through the 'portal' and into Earth, ensuing destruction and chaos at the facility.</p>
        <p>After the incident had unfolded, the military quickly intervened at the facility to neutralise all witnesses—scientists and security guards alike—to avoid word of the incident from reaching public knowledge.</p>
        <p>The player is responsible to bring Dr. Gordon Freeman, a recent MIT graduate, who is the silent main character of the first-person shooter game, to safety and kill alien creatures and military personnel that come their way.</p>

        <h2 id="#gameorigin">Origins of Half-Life</h2>
        <p>Half-Life was the first product for the software-developer Valve Software. The company conceptualised an idea for a horror first-person shooter game. Initially, Valve had struggled to find any publisher because many of them believed that their new product was too ambitious for a game developer as new as Valve. However, they were able to break a deal with a publisher, Sierra On-Line, which was interested in publishing a first-person shooter game.</p>
        <p>One of Valve's founders, Gabe Newell, explained that they used the name 'Half-Life' because it was not clichéd, fits the theme of the game, and the game had an evocative symbol, which is the Greek letter lambda, which represents the decay constant in the half-life equation. Hence, the name 'Half-Life' was used for the game.</p>

                <p>Carefully crafted for the single player experience, every encounter in Half-Life is a new challenge, nearly every room throws out something you haven't seen before, every sound is a worrying cue something horrible is about to happen. I haven't had so much fun playing a game in years.</p>

                <p>Environments are completely interactive. Players may turn on the hand dryers…or push open broken doors. Plus, the materials are realistic. Slippery floors are actually slippery. …It's tough to imagine someone who likes video games not absolutely loving this gem. </p>
